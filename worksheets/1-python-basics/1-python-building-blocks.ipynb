This is not something wrong with your Python code ([read more about floating point arithmetic in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)). However, if you fail to account for and mitigate rounding errors in programs you write, these errors can propagate through your code and disrupt things like comparisons, e.g. `var == 24` ... `False` . Go back to your code and the operators you used. Can you figure out where the rounding error might have occurred? Think about which operators create floating point numbers."
