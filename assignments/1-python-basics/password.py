"""
Various checkers for password strength.

This module contains a variety of functions that can be used to check passwords
for various sets of passwords rules, such as not using common blacklisted
passwords, using passwords of a certain length, or ensuring the use of various
character types in passwords. These functions can be used in conjunction to
provide more complex password checking.

    Check that a password is not one of the three most common passwords.

    Check whether or not the password is one of the three most common
    passwords: 123456, qwerty, or password. If the password does not match any
    of these, return True, and False otherwise.

    Args:
        password: A string representing the password to check.

    Count how many characters from a target string appear in another string.

    Given a target string and a string representing characters to count, count
    and return the number of characters in the target appear in the set of
    characters to count.

    As an example, if the target is "aaaabbcdef" and the set of characters to
    count is "bcd", then return 4, since "b" shows up twice in the target and
    "c" and "d" each show up once.

    Args:

        characters_to_count: A string representing the characters to count in

    * It is not one of the three most common passwords.
    * It is between 6 and 16 characters, inclusive.
