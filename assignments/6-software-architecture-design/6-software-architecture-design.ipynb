    "# Assignment 6: Software Architecture Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is intended to help you practice designing a software architecture for a larger code base. In some ways, the goal of this assignment is to prepare you for the final project in this course, walking you through the process of designing a multi-component software project. Specifically, you will be building on your design from the previous assignment to implement a game of tic-tac-toe.\n",

    "Your main task in this assignment is to implement a playable version of tic-tac-toe using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which you should have seen in [Reading 6](https://softdes.olin.edu/docs/readings/6-software-architecture-design/#the-model-view-controller-pattern). As the name suggests, the final product will consist of objects representing the model, the view, and the controller, as well as a function to tie all of these together to run the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MVC interactions](static/mvc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *model* represents the current state of the game, as well as the ways in which the game can be interacted with. In tic-tac-toe, the state of the game is the set of moves that have been made so far, as well as which player is the next to move. The ways of interacting with the game including marking a square, checking whether a player has won, etc.If you completed Assignment 5, you have already written implemented the model for the game. Even if you did not, an implementation of the model is available for you to use in `tic_tac_toe_board.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *view* is a representation of the model. In tic-tac-toe, the state of the game is just the board squares and whose turn it is (i.e., the next player to move), so the view is responsible for displaying these two pieces of information. Your first task in this assignment will be to implement a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *controller* provides a user interface for interacting with the model. In tic-tac-toe, a controller represents a player. It takes some input, such as typed text from the user, and converts this into an action like marking a square (which can be done with through the method provided by the model). In this assignment, you have the task of implementing a controllers that takes typed text input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will tie everything together using a function to set up and run a game of tic-tac-toe."

    "## 1. An Inherited View (and an Acquired Taste)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this assignment, you will only be creating a single view of tic-tac-toe, which represents the game in text form. To keep your design extensible in the future, it can be helpful to structure your view in two parts: a class that defines the methods that you can use to view the game, and a subclass that actually implements those methods. This is helpful because any kind of view (text, graphical, etc.) of a game of tic-tac-toe will use the same set of methods to display the game, making it easy to swap them out later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some starter code for implementing the view is in `tic_tac_toe_view.py`. You may find it helpful to have the code visible as you read the problem description below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. As Easy as `abc`\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Jackson 5 - ABC](static/abc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "No, not that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of writing a view is to create an *abstract base class*. The purpose of this class is to do some setup that is common to any view, as well as define the methods that need to be implemented to have a working view of the game. This class is called *abstract* because you cannot create an instance of it directly - the only way to use this class is to define a subclass that inherits from it, and then create an instance of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`abc` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) in the Python standard library provides a class called `ABC` that can be used to create an abstract base class. To do this, you need to declare a class that inherits from `ABC`, as you can see in the `TicTacToeView` class of `tic_tac_toe_view.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you need to write three methods in `TicTacToeView`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An `__init__` method that takes an instance of a `TicTacToeBoard` as a parameter and stores it as a private instance attribute.\n",
    "* A `board` property that returns the tic-tac-toe board stored in the `TicTacToeView` instance. (Remember that you can use the `@property` decorator from Assignment 5 to do this.)\n",
    "* A `draw` method that is an abstract method (see below) that does nothing (i.e., you can write `pass` as the body of the function).\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare an abstract method, you can use the `@abstractmethod` decorator, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@abstractmethod\n",
    "def foo(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't be able to easily test your code at this point, so once you have done this part, you can move onto the next part and test your code after that.\n",

    "### 1.2. A More Concrete View\n",
    "\n",
    "![Actual concrete](static/concrete.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "No, not that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to create a class that concretely implements the view of the abstract view interface you created in the previous part. Essentially, you can do this by writing a new class `TextView` that inherits from `TicTacToeView`. Because `TextView` is a subclass of `TicTacToeView`, it gets all of the attributes and methods of `TicTacToeView` automatically. Because `TicTacToeView` is an abstract class, the subclass `TextView` needs to override the `draw` method before you can create an instance of `TextView`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `TextView` class, implement the `draw` method, which should print the board, followed by a string stating whose turn it is. The string should be in the form `It is now X's turn.`. As an example, the `draw` method might print something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "+-+-+-+\n",
    "|O| | |\n",
    "+-+-+-+\n",
    "| |X| |\n",
    "+-+-+-+\n",
    "|X| | |\n",
    "+-+-+-+\n",
    "It is now O's turn.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed this problem, you should be able to see the above view by running the following code cell. (Note that your code also needs to pass the unit tests.)"

    "\n",

    "Then, implement `TextController` to override the `move` method. The `TextController` class only contains the `move` method, and this method should get input from the user and make an appropriate move on the board. The user's input is expected to be in the form `0 1`, where the first number represents the row of the board to mark and the second number represents the column. In this example `0 1` should try to mark row 0, column 1, which is the top center square of the board.\n",
    "\n",
