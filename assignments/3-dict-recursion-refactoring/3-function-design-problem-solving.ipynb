    "## 1. Markov Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Markov text generator* is a way of generating random but (somewhat) coherent text from an existing text. Essentially, a Markov text generator uses a *source text* (which can be only a few words, but is usually a larger text like a novel) to build a model of what words tend to follow each given word. It then uses this model to randomly select and build chains of words, forming sentences. (This is similar to how autocorrect and predictive text work on smartphones, but is based only on a single text.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we took a short source text, like \\\"I am Sam. I am Sam. Sam I am.\\\" (from Dr. Seuss's *Green Eggs and Ham*), a simple Markov text generator might end up generating a few sentences like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I am Sam. I am Sam. I am. Sam I am. Sam I am Sam.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the generated text looks quite similar to the source text, but also contains a few sentences that don't appear in the source text. The text is generated using a *first-order Markov process*, which essentially means that the word generated at any point depends only on the word that came before it (except at the beginning of a sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement a simple Markov text generator that produces sentences like this from *any* source text. Your code will be written in a file we have provided for you called `markov.py`. You can find the file in the same directory as this notebook.\n",

It would be great if we only had to deal with spaces, but as you can see in the string, there are other characters that in some ways act like spaces. The `\\n` characters denote a line break, and two of them (`\\n\\n`) denote a paragraph break. For the purposes of building the Markov model, spaces, line breaks, and paragraph breaks all fall into the category of *whitespace* (characters that represent spacing of various sizes) and should be considered equivalent.\n",

    "\n",
    "This step is the main portion of this problem. While the description for this step is a bit long, it explains several important features that may be helpful as you implement your function, so please read it in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `recursive_art.py`, you will find a function called `build_random_function`. Your first task is to write the docstring and implementation for `build_random_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you build these functions, we have provided you with four functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `average`: computes the average of two values.\n",
    "* `cosine`: computes the cosine of $\\pi$ times a value.\n",
    "* `multiply`: computes the product of two values.\n",
    "* `sine`: computes the sine of $\\pi$ times a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also provided you with two base functions, `first` and `second`, which take two values and return the first or second of those values, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of your function will involve randomly choosing an item of a list or an integer. To help you do this, we have made two functions from the `random` portion of the Python standard library available to you. The functions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `choice`: choose a random element from a list. As an example, `choice([1, 2, 3])` might return 2.\n",
    "* `randrange`: choose a random integer in a specified range. The parameters are exactly the same as for the `range` function, so `randrange(10)` would return a randomly chosen integer from 0 to 9, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The function itself takes two parameters, `min_depth` and `max_depth`, and returns a function of a specific depth. In this case, depth relates to the number of levels of \"nesting\" of mathematical functions before one of the base functions is returned. Here is a visual example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Illustration of function depth](static/function.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This final function in this case would be `average(y, multiply(cosine(x), x))`, or mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x, y) = \\frac{y + x \\cos(\\pi x)}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With a higher depth, you will get more complex functions. The parameter `min_depth` specifies how many levels deep all parts of your function *must* be, while `max_depth` specifies how deep they *can* be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth is part of what determines whether you should make a recursive call to `build_random_function`. Between `min_depth` and `max_depth`, you should decide whether to continue nesting functions by \"flipping a coin\". That is, with a 50% chance, make another recursive call, and with a 50% chance, return one of the base functions instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you nest a function (i.e., go one level deeper), you should select a random function from the four that we have provided. Depending on whether this function has one parameter or two, you should then generate one or two \"sub-functions\" that will then be combined by the functions that you have chosen. For example, if you select `multiply` at random, then you should generate two sub-functions, and then multiply their result.\n",
    "\n",
    "`build_random_function` should return a **function**. To do this, you can return a function by its name, like `return cosine`, but to build up a function that combines sub-functions, you will need to define an *inner function*, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def build_random_function(min_depth, max_depth):\n",
    "    # Do some stuff here...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    function =  # Randomly pick one of the four functions here\n",
    "    first_inner_function =  # Generate the inner function here\n",
    "    second_inner_function =  # Generate another inner function here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def random_function(x, y):\n",
    "        return  # Return the result of the function here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return random_function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, you define the inner function inside another function (for convenience, let's call this the outer function for now). When you do this, you have access to all variables defined in the outer function (including `function`, `first_inner_function`, and `second_inner_function`) and can use them as you define the inner function (i.e., you can use or otherwise call `function`, `first_inner_function`, and `second_inner_function` within the inner function).\n",

    "## 3. Alternatives for Alternative Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all elections in the United States are decided by a system called *first-past-the-post* voting - everyone votes for a single candidate, and whoever gets the most votes wins. Unfortunately, a bit of mathematics and game theory can show that first-past-the-post voting has some serious flaws in the long term, as excellently explained in this CGP Grey's video [\"The Problems with First Past the Post Voting Explained\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you will be using Python to **refactor an existing implemention of an alternative voting system**, which goes by a number of names, commonly *instant runoff voting*.

    "[[\"Sam\", \"Morgan\", \"Jordan\", \"Robin\"], [\"Sam\", \"Robin\", \"Jordan\"], [\"Jordan\", \"Morgan\"], ...]\n",

    "Each vote ranks the possible candidates from most to least preferred, but as you can see, not all candidates have to be ranked. Then, candidates with the least support are successively eliminated, and votes for that candidate are transferred to other candidates. This process continues until a single candidate has more than 50% of the votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alternative Vote video above explains how this process works in more detail, but here is a written description of the voting process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go through all of the votes and count one vote for each person's *highest-ranked candidate remaining in the race*. (At the beginning, this is just everyone's first choice, but in later rounds, a person's most preferred candidates may have already been eliminated.) If all of a person's preferred candidates have been eliminated, that person's vote is not counted.\n",
    "2. If anyone has more than a 50% majority, that person is *immediately* declared the winner - no further work is required. Note that this majority is of the total votes that were cast *in this round* - if all of a person's candidates were eliminated, their vote is not included in the total number of votes.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, find the candidate with the *fewest* votes and eliminate them from the running.\n",
    "4. Repeat this process until the winner is chosen. This process is *guaranteed* to eventually choose a winner, since as votes \"transfer\" to other candidates, someone will eventually get more than 50% of the votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see a written, fully worked-out example of this process, you can take a look at Wikpedia's description of [a fictional vote on the Tennessee state capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting#Tennessee_capital_election).\n",

The parameter `ranked_votes` is a list of lists representing each voter's ranked votes for the candidates, as shown in the class president example above. The function returns a tuple of two items: (1) a string representing the name of the winning candidate, and (2) the number of votes they got when they were declared the winner.\n",

The single transferable voting process has a fairly straightforward way of making this problem smaller - if you are stuck, you should read the description of the process from the previous assignment.

There are many possible reasons for why you might have found one easier than the other - you have the benefit of having the iterative solution already, and if that made a big difference, you should mention so. But remember that there can be other factors at play as well, such as how intuitive the problem-solving approach felt to you or your comfort with the specific features of Python you used in each solution."
