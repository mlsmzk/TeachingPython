    "# Assignment 0: Introduction to Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to teach you the basics of working with tools you will use in assignments: a bit of Python, a bit of Jupyter notebooks and Markdown, and a bit of Bash and Git. It's also designed to help you understand the submission process we use in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please read these instructions carefully. Failure to follow these instructions may result in you not receiving credit on this assignment.** These instructions may seem pedantic, but our testing workflow depends on a very specific setup to grade your work accurately and save our CAs time. Real-world automated software testing also tends to check for exact matches to a set of specifications, so learning to be attentive to detail early on will serve you well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, your job in this assignment is to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill in an intake survey to tell us a bit more about yourself and what you want out of this course.\n",
    "2. Run unit tests on your code. In this assignment, this is to make sure that you didn't accidentally input an invalid value into the intake survey, but in the future assignments, you'll use these tests to get a sense of how well your code is working.\n",
    "3. Run an autoformatter on your code. This makes sure that your code is using a consistent style that is easier for others to read.\n",
    "4. Run a style check on your code, and fix any outstanding issues. There are a few edge cases that autoformatters can't fix automatically, so it's important to check that your code is styled properly even after running the autoformatter.\n",
    "5. Signal that you are done working on the assignment, or that you are taking one or more late days, by changing the contents of a status file.\n",
    "6. Use Git on the command line to submit your assignment. This involves staging your changes to the intake survey, committing your changes, and then pushing your commit to your fork of the course repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading and feedback on this assignment (and on all assignments in this course) will be based on a rubric distributed with the assignment. You can find the rubric in `rubric-0.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on with this assignment, run the following code cell, which will make sure this notebook loads the latest version of your survey responses each time."

    "## 1. Intake Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill out the intake survey, open the file `intake_survey.py` in VSCode. This file contains some variables that you should fill in with your survey responses. If you want to get a sense of what a filled-out survey will look like and how it should be properly formatted, take a look at `sample_responses.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you fill in your survey, please keep the following things in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not answering an optional question, please leave the line unchanged. This will help us determine which questions you have actually answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't use halves (e.g., 2.5) when describing your previous experience level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line Length\n",
    "\n",
    "For name, pronunciation, pronouns, or description of previous experience, please make sure that your lines are limited to **80 characters long**. This might be tedious, but even in these modern times, many code editors/viewers do not wrap long lines properly. You can check the length of your lines in VSCode by looking at the bottom right corner of your window (where it says something like \"Ln 42, Col 80\") - if the column number at the end of your line is *greater than 81* (since the column number is the space to the right of the cursor), the line is too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the line is long, you can *break* the line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "long_line = \"Pretend this is a long, long line...break\" \\\n",
    "            \" here and continue the rest of the line\" \\\n",
    "            \" even further if you'd like.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\\` itself should be at or before the 80-character mark, so the last complete word before it needs to end at column 78 or less. Also note that all lines of the string after the first should start with a space and should be aligned to the start of the first line of the string, as shown above (and in the sample responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text in Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning goals and concerns in the surveys are lists, so you can include multiple goals or concerns, with each one being a string. As you can see in `sample_responses.py`, strings in lists should be indented by **4 spaces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a list, the `\\` character at the end of a long string is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of each learning goal or concern, put a comma after the end of the string. You can do this even after the last string in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check\n",
    "\n",
    "We've written some code to help you check that you've filled in your intake survey properly. **You don't have to understand this code for now.** But, by the end of this class, you should be able to write and understand code like this!\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to check that the output matches what you'd expect. (You may notice long lines breaking in some places - this is fine.)"

    "## 2. Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will use *unit tests* on your submitted code to check that it is working as intended. For this assignment, you are simply filling in the values of different variables, so there isn't much to check. Still, it's good to check that you answered all required questions in the survey with valid values. In this course, we'll be using a test framework called pytest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using one of the options below, run unit tests for this assignment in pytest and make sure that they all pass. You won't get full credit for this assignment if any of the tests don't pass, so be sure to fix any errors that you see!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Option 1: Run pytest in the Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple way is to open a terminal (in Ubuntu), navigate (`cd`) to the folder that this assignment is in, and run the command `pytest`. It will print output that report information including how many tests it ran, how many passed, how many failed, and how long it took.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Option 2: Run pytest in VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is to run the tests from within VSCode. Open this assignment folder in VSCode by going to File -> Open Folder (Ctrl-K then Ctrl-O; note that Ctrl-O is used to open a single file and **will not work here**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, open the Command Palette (Ctrl-Shift-P in Ubuntu) and type in \"test\". You should see an option that says \"Python: Run All Tests\". Select this option, which will give you a message that says \"No test framework configured\", with an option to \"Enable and configure a Test Framework\". Select that, and you should see a drop-down menu that allows you to pick from several testing frameworks - select \"pytest\". Finally, you will be asked to \"Select the directory containing the tests\" - select \". Root directory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done this, you should see a \"Run Tests\" option next to a lightning bolt symbol at the lower left of VSCode. Click it (it's a button), and then you see a drop-down option to \"Run All Tests\". Click that to run the unit tests. You should see the button replaced with an indicator of how many tests passed and how many failed (there are 7 tests in total for this assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see the output of the test run as it would appear if you ran pytest from the Terminal, click on the \"Run Tests\" button (which may now instead show the number of passing and failing tests) and select the \"View Test Output\" option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Autoformat Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to style your Python code - for example, some people prefer to leave whitespace around arithmetic operators and some prefer not to (e.g., `2 + 2` vs `2+2`). Vast differences in style can make it difficult to read other people's code, so groups within the Python community have developed their own style guidelines to ensure consistency across projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we mostly adhere to a style called [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (totally optional to look at, unless you really, *really* like style guides). If you're new to Python, it can be a lot of mental overhead to remember and follow all of the style rules, so we instead encourage you to make use of an autoformatter, which edits your code to match PEP8. (Tools like this are becoming standard practice at many software companies, as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we use an autoformatter called autopep8. Run this on your `intake_survey.py` file by opening a Terminal in Ubuntu, navigating to this directory, and running the command `autopep8 -i intake_survey.py`. The `-i` tells autopep8 to edit your file in-place, meaning it edits the file directly rather than printing out what your properly formatted code should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Find and Fix Remaining Style Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "We just got done telling you how great autopep8 is, but there's something you should know: **autopep8 doesn't always fix everything for you**. There are some issues that are simply too difficult to fix automatically. Therefore, even after you've run autopep8, you'll need to style-check your code to be sure that there aren't any lingering issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, an issue that you're likely to encounter after running autopep8 is a string that is too long. Splitting long strings across multiple lines is difficult for reasons that we won't get into here (but you can ask on Discord if you're curious). You should thus run a style checker on your code to make sure that you don't have this or any other style issues in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, we've provided you with a tool called Pylint. To run this, make sure you're in this directory in Terminal, and run the command `pylint intake_survey.py`. This will print out a list of style issues with your code file (if any), followed by a \"style score\" of your code out of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Pylint reports any lingering errors, you should take some time to fix them. If you get errors about lines being too long, you can fix them by formatting your strings according to the \"Line Length\" section in Part 1 of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Edit the Status File\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory also contains a file called `STATUS`. We partially use this file for grading purposes, but it's also used for you to signal to us that your assignment is ready to grade, or that you're taking late days.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have completed the steps above and are ready to submit your assignment, edit the `STATUS` file and change the first word in the file from `assigned` to `ready`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not taking any late days, leave the second word as `0`. **If you are taking late days, change this `0` to the number of late days you want to take.** As a reminder of what [the syllabus says about late days](https://softdes.olin.edu/docs/syllabus/assessment/#late-days), you get a maximum of 4 late days by default, and each late day grants you an extension of 24 hours to the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Submit this Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done the above, you're ready to submit! Follow the steps below to get your changes into GitHub and submit your first assignment for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Even if you are taking late days, you must check changes into GitHub as described above to receive your extension.** The only exception to this is in the case of an emergency, which is [described in the syllabus](https://softdes.olin.edu/docs/syllabus/assessment/#emergencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Your Status Often\n",
    "\n",
    "At any point during these instructions, you can see what is going on in Git using the command `git status`. If anything goes wrong with Git, your first step should be to run `git status` to see what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with that out of the way, let's move onto submitting your assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Step 1: Stage Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you'll need to do is to *stage* your changes to `intake_survey.py` and `STATUS`, which essentially tells Git to mark the current version of those file as part of your changes to commit. To do this, run the following command from this directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add intake_survey.py STATUS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If it runs correctly, this command should produce no output, but `git status` should show modifications to `intake_survey.py` and `STATUS` under \"Changes to be committed\" rather than under \"Changes not staged for commit\". (For this assignment, you can ignore other files that are listed as changed but not staged, such as this notebook file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Step 2: Commit Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, *commit* your changes to your copy of the repository, which packages up your staged files as a single unit of change to the repository. To do this, run the following command from this directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open VSCode with a file to type in. You should write a message in this file that describes the set of changes that you have made. While we won't be enforcing any strict guidelines for these messages, you should make sure that they are descriptive, because knowing what you changed and why is important when working with long-running or complex software projects. Based on our [guidelines in Reading 0](https://softdes.olin.edu/docs/readings/0-intro-to-assignments/#committing-your-changes), here is a template that we suggest you use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Summarize change in 50 characters or less\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer description of change. Describe why you are making this change,\n",
    "as well as any outstanding issues. Maximum line length in this section\n",
    "should be 72 characters, as Git relies on this for nicely displaying\n",
    "this information back to you. This section is optional for simple\n",
    "changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done writing your commit message, save and close this file. You should then see a short message in the Terminal summarizing the commit. At this point, running `git status` should say something like \"Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.\" with potentially some other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Step 3: Push Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though you've committed your changes to Git, these changes still only live in your local copy of the repository, that is, the copy of the repository on your computer. To make your submission visible to GitHub so that we can see and grade it, you'll need to *push* your commit to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "To push your commit, simply run the following command from this directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If successful, this should also print some information about the status of the push (mostly information about transferring files and other data). At this point, running `git status` should again say something like \"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\" when run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Step 4: Check Submission on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing Step 3, we are able to see your work for grading. However, it is easy to *think* that your work has been submitted correctly when in reality, something has gone wrong. To avoid missed submissions due to this, we ask that you double-check that your changes are visible on GitHub - if it is, we will be also able to see these changes during grading. **If we begin grading and your latest changes are not visible on GitHub, your assignment will be considered late.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, navigate to your Assignment 0 folder **on GitHub**. This should be something like https://github.com/USERNAME/softdes-2022-01/tree/main/assignments/0-intro-to-assignments, where USERNAME is replaced with your GitHub username. You are strongly encouraged here to take a look at your `intake_survey.py` and `STATUS` files and make sure that they contain your latest changes. If you want, you can also check that those two files show their latest modification as being seconds or minutes ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done the above, take a moment to pat yourself on the back - you've just submitted your first assignment in this course, and learned a lot about Python and Git along the way!"
