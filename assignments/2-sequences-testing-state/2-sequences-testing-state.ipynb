    "## 1. Parenthesis Antithesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will not be implementing any functions, but you will write unit tests for pytest to test other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem you will be thinking about in this exercise is called *parenthesis matching*, a common puzzle and programming problem. (This is in fact a very similar process to how Python detects syntax errors for not closing parentheses.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In parenthesis matching, you are given a string which can contain any number of left and right parentheses (`(` and `)`). The string will not contain any characters that are not a left or right parenthesis. You then need to determine whether this string's parentheses match or not. As you match parentheses, you should keep in mind the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every left parenthesis (`(`) needs to have a matching right parenthesis (`)`) somewhere to its right in the string. So `()` would match, but `)(` would not.\n",
    "2. Matching needs to happen in the proper order. As you go through the string from left to right, whenever you hit a right parenthesis, it matches the closest left parenthesis that has not already been matched. For example, if you go through `(())`, when you hit the third character (the first right parenthesis), it matches the second character (which is right next to it). The fourth character (the last right parenthesis) can then only match to the first left parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this exercise is to write unit tests for functions that implement parenthesis matching and to determine which of these are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write Unit Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given two simple unit tests (with a short comment explaining each) to start, but to gain a more concrete understanding of how parenthesis matching should work under different test cases, you need to add more unit tests. In the file `test_paren_matching.py`, we have created a framework for you to add test cases in. The variable `UNIT_TEST_CASES` at the top of the file contains some sample tuples of two items like `(\"()\", True)`, which represent a single unit test. In these tuples, the left item is the string of parentheses to test and the right item is a boolean representing whether this string is expected to match or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tests will be run against a solution you know to be correct as well as 14 other implementations that we have written, numbered 0 through 13 (inclusive). Some of these work correctly, and others do not. It is your job to determine which ones are correct and which ones are not. To make things a bit trickier, you are not provided with the Python source code for these implementations - we have instead provided compiled versions of the implementations in the `compiled` folder. (Yes, compiling Python code like you might do with code in Java is a thing, though it's a bit more of a finicky process.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also provided you with a correct implementation of the function, which you can see defined in `test_paren_matching.py` as `correct_solution`. You can feel free to look through that code to see how it works, or to add your own tests as above and see what the correct solution outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run these tests with `pytest test_paren_matching.py` in the directory for this assignment. A test that fails will be reported to you with an identifier that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "test_paren_matching.py::test_correctness[1-)(-False]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that this identifier reports which implementation failed (`1`), what its input was (`)(`), and the expected result (`False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this step, add as many unit tests as you feel are necessary to determine whether each of the 14 implementations is correct or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we have created a list with different test cases in them at the top of the `test_paren_matching.py` file. This list is called `UNIT_TEST_CASES`, and consists of pairs written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Add your test cases here.\n",
    "UNIT_TEST_CASES = [\n",
    "    # Check that a simple pair of parentheses is accepted.\n",
    "    (\"()\", True),\n",
    "    # Check that a pair of parentheses in the wrong order is rejected.\n",
    "    (\")(\", False),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pair is a string to check (`\"()\"`, in the first case), followed by the expected output of the parenthesis matching implementation (`True`, in the first case). This pair is actually a data type we haven't seen yet (a tuple), but for now, you can think of it as a list with parentheses instead of square brackets. Use the format shown above to write your tests, with a comment describing each test case and the test case on the following line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test case, your comment should indicate what the case represents (for example, `\")(\"` represents a matching pair of parentheses, but in the wrong order) so that we can get an insight into your testing mindset. As you do this, try to illustrate your thought process in creating this *set* of tests, in addition to the individual test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some more guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The unit tests you start with show that at least 5 of the 14 implementations have bugs. Your solution must provide unit tests that cause **at least one additional implementation to fail**.\n",
    "* That being said, **no test you add should cause our provided correct solution to fail**. If you see something like `test_paren_matching.py::test_correctness[correct-)(-False]` in the test results (note that it is identified with `correct` instead of a number), you should not include this test in your final submitted version. Feel free to write about it below, however, this will help us better understand your thought process as you test the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine Correct Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have run what you feel to be a sufficient set of unit tests, you should be able to identify which implementations are behaving correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `test-report.md`, list these implementations (by number) and explain why you believe they are correct. (Clearly, it's partly because they pass all of the unit tests, but you should explain why you believe your unit tests have covered most or all of the possible cases in which an implementation of this function might fail.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not confident that these are the correct implementations, you should still try to provide some reasoning for why you believe they are correct."

    "## 2. `next_palindrome(393)` Not Found\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, you have probably encountered and fixed at least a few bugs in your code. In this problem, you will get the chance to find, diagnose, and fix a bug in some code. The bug is intentionally designed to be fixed quickly once found, so much of the value of this problem is ~~the friends we made along the way~~ the process of discovering the bug and finding its cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `palindrome.py`, we have provided you a function called `next_palindrome`. This function takes an integer that is *already a palindrome (the same backwards and forwards)*, like 393. It then returns the next integer (counting upwards) that is also a palindrome, which in this case would be [404](https://www.marvel.com/404). You should assume that this function will not work if given a number that is not a palindrome, like 8114.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the code as written contains a bug that makes it behave incorrectly. Your job is to find and fix this bug, and document your findings. The following steps are intended to take you through the process that a programmer might follow when faced with a bug in code.\n",

    "### Bug Watching\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Run the cell with different starting palindromic values, and see if you can find a case where you get an incorrect result from `next_palindrome`. You can pick numbers randomly, but we strongly encourage you to think through this systematically. You might do this by reading through the functions in `palindrome.py`, or you might try to think about cases that are likely to trip up `next_palindrome`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you run these tests, keep some notes in the file `palindrome-report.md` that highlight test cases that helped you gain more information about the possible bug in `next_palindrome`. You might write something like this for a given test case:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I tried `next_palindrome(0)` because it is the only palindromic number that is 0 by itself, and I wanted to see how the function worked with this input. It behaved correctly, helping me eliminate that as a trigger of the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the relevant section of `palindrome-report.md` with at least **three** test cases, along with your reasoning for each. At least one of these test cases should be an example of `next_palindrome` not working correctly."
